#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to discover important information regarding utilization of Citi Bike in New York in order to determine whether starting a similar operation is feasible. We've chosen August as the month to analyze since summer month would be similar across the US. We need to know when the bikes are used, for how long they are used, and who is using them.

The first visualization shows that Citi Bike provides a great option for short tips in New York for all kinds of people. The image below shows the results of two different analyses: Checkout times for users and checkout times by gender.

Riders' starting and ending locations are similar across the city. It indicates the company does not have to spend lots of time and money repositioning bikes; however, NYC is a mega metrpolis, this may be the reason for the utilization of bikes in the city. Similar situation may not be the same for more suburban cities.

#### Summary 
The visualizations do tell the story. More subscribers utilize the bike than regular users, more male utilize the bikes more than females and more usage during the weekdays than weekends. These indicators are great but also implies more details. NYC is a big city. Higher concentration of population may need a share bike operation. Similar operation for city that is more spread out like Seattle, may not seen the same result. In order to make a sound recommendation, we need to gauge if the locations are similar in other factors.
